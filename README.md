# Hand-tracking-Project
Real-time Hand Tracking Application:  
This Python program utilizes the mediapipe and cv2 libraries to create a real-time hand tracking application. 
The code captures live video from a webcam and detects hand landmarks using the mp_hands module. 
It renders the detected hand landmarks on the video frames and provides coordinates for analysis.
The application showcases proficiency in computer vision techniques, including image processing, landmark detection, and real-time visualization
